Install `react-toast-msg` using your preferred package manager:

```package-install copyable
react-toast-msg
```

## Peer Dependencies

Ensure you have `react` and `react-dom` installed (version 18 or 19).

```json
"peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18 || ^19",
    "react-dom": "^18 || ^19"
}
```

## Styling

Since `react-toast-msg` uses Tailwind CSS for styling, you should import the CSS file in your main application entry point (e.g., `app/layout.tsx` or `src/index.tsx`):

```tsx copyable
import "react-toast-msg/style.css";
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Tailwind CSS in your project, ensure that your configuration includes the necessary styles or that you are importing the provided CSS.
