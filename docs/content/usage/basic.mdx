The `toast` function is a versatile tool for showing notifications. 

## Simple Notifications

The most common way to show a toast is by using one of the shorthand methods:

```tsx copyable
import { toast } from "react-toast-msg";

// Success toast
toast.success("Action completed!");

// Error toast
toast.error("Something went wrong.");

// Warning toast
toast.warning("Check your settings.");

// Default/Info toast
toast("Here is some information.");
```

## Custom Message

You can pass any string as the first argument to these methods.

```tsx copyable
toast.success("Order #12345 has been shipped!");
```

## Timing

By default, toasts disappear after **3 seconds**. You can change the global duration in `ToastContainer` or set it per-toast (see [Advanced Usage](/docs/usage/advanced)).
