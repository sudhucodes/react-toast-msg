Here are some common usage patterns for `react-toast-msg`.

## Form Submission

Show a success or error toast based on form submission results.

```tsx copyable
const handleSubmit = async (data) => {
  try {
    await submitData(data);
    toast.success("Data saved successfully!");
  } catch (err) {
    toast.error("Failed to save data. Please try again.");
  }
};
```

## Loading States (Manual)

While the library doesn't have a built-in promise handler yet, you can easily simulate it:

```tsx copyable
const handlePromise = async () => {
  // Show a default info toast
  toast.default("Processing...");
  
  const result = await myPromise();
  
  if (result.success) {
    toast.success("Completed!");
  } else {
    toast.error("Error occurred.");
  }
};
```

## Custom Layouts

Since `react-toast-msg` is lightweight, you can use it alongside other UI components easily.
